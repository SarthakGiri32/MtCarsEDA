## Executive Summary

In this project, analysis of the `mtcars` data set is done; and the relationship between some variables and the Miles per Gallon (MPG) of cars is explored and analyzed. The main questions that are solved in this project are:

* Is and automatic or manual transmission better for MPG ?  
* Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmission
